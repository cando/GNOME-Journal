What’s this Journal thing anyway?

“Well, it’s like the facebook timeline, but this one is private and under your control. You can control what goes in, can delete items or events from the journal as well as configure what gets displayed. Data ownership remains solely with you, unless you want to share with others. Not everyone is comfortable with the idea of sharing personal information, of living in full view on the Web. So, no porous, leaking boundaries. No personal information collected by third parties. And hey, it’s open source. Thus, no “Don’t be evil.” proclamations needed. You can trust the tool, as its behavior specification is traceable: you and others can get, read and compile the code.
Importantly, this private journal not only covers your social activities but also your other doings. And ‘Heads up!’, it’s for yourself only: compared to information you publish (e.g., via social networks), this is personal information space. So, what’s covered is generally more comprehensive and more accurate, and you don’t have to care about constructing a favorable picture of yourself. Just relax: it’s only ‘you observing you’.
This journal thing might serve for overviewing some part of the story of your life and for reflecting about it. Also, you can search and filter in cooler ways than what is possible with your facebook timeline. The journal helps you re-find and re-access your stuff and the people involved as well as conversations held, and it assists you in task resumption in unprecedented ways. Finally, you can choose the layout to be horizontal vs. vertical. … and more.”
